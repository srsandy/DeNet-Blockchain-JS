## What is Blockchain?
An *Immutable*, *Distributed Ledger.*

Lets Break it down
  - `Ledger` -> collection of financial accounts and transactions (Record of transaction people have made) 
  - `Immutable` -> ledger cannot be changed ever (the record is set in stones)
  - `Distributed` -> ledger is not controlled by a single entity

**BLOCKCHAIN**: A distributed network, this means that any given blockchain network is not controlled by a single entity but instead it is run by normal everyday people. 
So here the ledger is not in the hands of a single company. But is persisted by 1000's of people around there who are all acting ideally and independently. 
Each person who contributes to the blockchain network is called a NODE. Each node has the exact same copy of the ledger. So the ledger data is hosted and synchronised on the whole network.
